This talk presents a Data Challenge focused on improving short-term electricity net demand forecasting in the context of a decentralized power grid. The complexities arising from the increasing integration of renewable energy sources, and the uncertainties associated with their fluctuations, underline the need for accurate demand forecasting. Challenge participants aim to forecast net consumption, i.e. total consumption minus renewable production – solar and wind –, in France, using data available at different geographical resolutions (regional and national), as well as electricity price data. This paper first presents the context of the problem of net electricity demand forecasting, and then presents some of the interesting solutions produced for the Challenge.
